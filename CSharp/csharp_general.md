# Auto Property
- Easy to use
- Provide OOP encapsulation without much hassle like in Java

## Example
  
```
public class Player 
{
    public int Health { get; private set; }

    // Changing Health is only allowed inside Player due to private set
    public void TakeDamage(int damage)
    {
        this.Health -= damage;
        if(this.Health < 0)
        {
            this.Health = 0;
        }
    }
}
```

```
public class SomeOtherClass
{
    [SerializeField]
    private Player player;

    private Text healthText

    ...

    private void UpdateHealthText()
    {
        // Simply call Health as if it's a getter method
        this.healthText.text = player.Health.ToString();
    }

    private void SetHealthToZero()
    {
        // This will result in compile error as Health property is private set
        player.Health = 0;
    }
}
```

# Magic Numbers are illegal

## Q: What are magic numbers?
## A: A number that appears from nowhere in the code
```
if(x <= 0.6f) {...}
```

## What's the problem? It looks pretty fine!
- Low readability, other people won't know what does the number mean
- May leads into inconsistency throughout the code as typos could happen
- It's possible that you have to edit numbers so many places
- Not just for numbers to be honest, but applies to any data type

## Instead, just do this really!

```
const float thresholdToDestroy = 0.6f;

...

if(x <= thresholdToDestroy){...}
```

# Linq
Use Linq, but beware of GC, donâ€™t use it in Update()

```
arr[arr.Count - 1];
arr.Last();
```

# Lambda expression 
only use it in obvious functions

```
public void ClearMiddleText() => middleScreenText.text = "";

# Abstraction
	
Try to use Interface if it can be adaptable. For example, use IEnumerable instead of List<T> so that we can use any class extended from more general type like Queue<T>

Another perk is that we can create mock of interface for testing

# Floating point comparing
	
	Even though the == comparison almost never really happens, we still should compare >= or <= in the code if it associates with the logic well, reason? To prevent confusing when working in team

public static bool ReadyToDisplayAds => durationSinceLastShowAds >= calculatedTimeToShowAds;

Technically operator > should suffice but it may confuse other programmers

# Extension Methods
## KeyValuePairExtension
public static class KeyValuePairExtension
{
public static void Deconstruct<TKey, TValue>(
      	this KeyValuePair<TKey,TValue> kvp, 
      out TKey key, 
      out TValue value)
{
key = kvp.Key;
value = kvp.Value;
}
}

# String Interpolation

foreach (var (stateName, soundName) in stateToSound)
            {
                if (stateInfo.shortNameHash == stateName)
                {
                    AudioManager.Instance.Play(soundName);
                }
            }

private Dictionary<int, Sound.SoundName> stateToSound = new Dictionary<int, Sound.SoundName>()
        { 
            { AnimatorStateName.HitState, Sound.SoundName.Hit }, 
            { AnimatorStateName.BurnedState, Sound.SoundName.Fire }, 
            { AnimatorStateName.FlattenState, Sound.SoundName.Hit }
        };
